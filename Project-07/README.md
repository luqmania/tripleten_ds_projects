# Introduction
The mobile operator Megaline is dissatisfied because many of their users are still using the old package. The company wants to develop a model that can analyze consumer behavior and recommend one of Megaline's two newest packages: Surf or Ultimate.

The researcher has access to behavioral data of users who have switched to the newest package (from the Statistical Data Analysis course project). In this classification task, the researcher needs to develop a model that is able to choose the right package.

# Objectives
The researcher will develop a model that chooses the right package for a user based on behavioral data of customers who have switched to the new package, Smart or Ultra. The researcher is looking for a model that is at least 75% accurate. Since this is a classification task, we will test the Decision Tree classifier, the Random Forest classifier, and the Logistic Regression classifier.

Conducting classification testing with models:
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression

# Stages
User behavior data from the Megaline cellular operator stored in the file */datasets/users_behavior.csv*

Considering that the researcher has completed the data pre-processing steps, the researcher can go directly to the model creation stage. The data can be directly tested on the classification model that will be used by dividing it into data sets:
- train set
- valid set
- test set

This project will consist of two stages:
- Data Overview
- Analysis
