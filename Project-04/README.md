# Introduction
The researcher works as an analyst for a telecommunications operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The advertising department wants to know which prepaid plan generates more revenue to adjust the advertising budget. The researcher will conduct a preliminary analysis of the prepaid plans based on a relatively small sample of clients. The researcher will have 500 Megaline clients' data: who they are, where they are from, what type of plan they use, and the number of calls and messages they send in 2018.

# Objectives
Analyze client behavior and determine which prepaid plan generates more revenue. In more detail, describe consumer behavior by finding the minutes, messages, and volume of mobile data usage that users of each plan need per month. Test the following hypotheses:
1. The average income of Ultimate and Surf phone plan users is different.
2. The average income of users in the NY-NJ area is different from the income of users from other areas.

# Stages
Data about customers and services from the telecommunications operator Megaline are stored in the following files:
- */datasets/megaline_calls.csv*
- */datasets/megaline_internet.csv*
- */datasets/megaline_messages.csv*
- */datasets/megaline_plans.csv*
- */datasets/megaline_users.csv*

There is no information regarding the quality of the data, so it needs to be checked first before further analysis.

First, an evaluation of the data quality will be carried out and see if there are any significant things that need to be followed up before the analysis process is carried out, including:
- Converting data to the required data type
- Finding and eliminating errors in the data

This project will consist of four stages:
- Data Overview
- Data Pre-processing
- Analysis Process
- Hypothesis Testing
