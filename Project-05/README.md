# Introduction
The researcher works for the Ice online store, which sells video games worldwide. The researcher has access to user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales. The researcher needs to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. This will allow us to identify potential major winners and plan advertising campaigns.

# Objectives
Analyze the factors that contribute to the success of video games. Identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not.

Test the following hypotheses:
1. The average user rating for the Xbox One and PC platforms is the same.
2. The average user rating for the Action and Sports genres is not the same.

# Stages
Data about games and their devices sold in the Ice online store are stored in the file */datasets/games.csv*

There is no information about the quality of the data, so it needs to be checked before further analysis.

First, an evaluation of the data quality will be carried out and see if there are any significant things that need to be followed up before the analysis process is carried out, including:
- Converting data into the required data type
- Finding and eliminating errors in the data

This project will consist of four stages:
- Data Overview
- Data Pre-processing
- Analysis Process
- Hypothesis Testing
