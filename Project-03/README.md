# Stages
Data about vehicle advertisements from the website is stored in the file */datasets/vehicles_us.csv*. There is no information regarding the quality of the data, so it needs to be checked first before further analysis.

First, an evaluation of the data quality will be carried out and see if there are any significant things that need to be followed up before the analysis process is carried out.

Related to the analysis process to be carried out, the following data needs to be added:
- Day of the week, month, and year the advertisement was aired
- Vehicle age (in years) when the advertisement was aired
- Average vehicle mileage per year
- String values ​​in conditions are replaced with a numeric scale

This project will consist of three stages:
- Data Overview
- Data Pre-processing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
