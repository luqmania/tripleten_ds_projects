# Introduction
This project is intended to prepare a report for the credit department of a bank. The report will look for the relationship between several factors and the probability of default in repaying a loan. The bank already has some data on the creditworthiness of customers. Your report will be taken into consideration when making a credit assessment for potential customers. Credit assessments are used to evaluate the ability of potential borrowers to repay their loans.

# Objectives
Test four relationships:
1. Is there a relationship between having children and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
2. Is there a relationship between marital status and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
3. Is there a relationship between income level and the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?
4. How do different loan purposes affect the probability of a person defaulting on a loan?

# Stages
The data about loan customers is stored in the file */datasets/credit_scoring_eng.csv*. There is no information about the quality of the data, so it needs to be checked first before testing the hypothesis.

First, you will evaluate the quality of the data and see if the problems are significant. Then, during data pre-processing, you will try to address the most serious problems.

This project will consist of three stages:
- Data Overview
- Data Pre-processing
- Relationship Analysis
