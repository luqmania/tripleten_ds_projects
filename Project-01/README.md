# Introduction
Whenever we do analysis, we need to formulate some hypotheses that we need to test further. Sometimes, the tests we do lead us to accept the hypothesis, sometimes we need to reject it. To make the right decisions in business, we need to understand whether the assumptions we make are correct or not.

In this project, you will compare the music preferences of users in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. You will study real Y.Music data to test the following hypotheses and compare user behavior in these two cities.

# Objectives
Test three hypotheses:
1. User activity varies depending on the day and city.
2. On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. This also applies on Friday nights.
3. Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In Springfield, users prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville rap music has more fans.

# Stages
Data about user behavior is stored in the file */datasets/music_project_en.csv*. There is no information about the quality of the data, so you need to check it first before testing the hypothesis.

First, you will evaluate the quality of the data and see if the problems are significant. Then, during data preprocessing, you will try to address the most serious problems.

This project will consist of three stages:
- Data Overview
- Data Preprocessing
- Hypothesis Testing
