# Introduction
Beta Bank customers are leaving the company: little by little, their numbers are decreasing every month. The bank employees realize that it would be more cost-effective if the company focused on retaining their loyal old customers rather than attracting new ones.

The researcher helped Beta Bank to predict whether customers would leave or stay based on their Credit Score, Geographical Location, Gender, Age, Tenure (how long they have been with the bank), Balance, Number of Products they use, whether they have a credit card, whether they are active customers, and Estimated Salary. This information has been collected in a dataset that the researcher will study later.

# Objectives
In this case, the researcher's task is to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon or not.

Modeling with:
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression

Addressing class imbalance with:
- Class Weight Adjustment
- Upsampling

# Stages
The researcher has data related to clients stored in the file */datasets/Churn.csv*

There is no information regarding the quality of the data, so it needs to be checked first before doing further analysis.

First, the data quality will be evaluated and see if there are any significant things that need to be followed up before the analysis process is carried out.

The project will consist of four stages:
- Data Overview
- Data Pre-processing
- Analysis
- Testing
