# Introduction
The researcher works at the OilyGiant mining company. The researcher is tasked with finding the best place to develop 200 new oil well points.

The OilyGiant Mining Company has oil reserve data in 3 regions, 1 dataset for each region. We will train a Linear Regression model for each region to predict the volume contained and calculate the revenue for each region, and use the findings to determine the region with the highest profit margin.

# Objectives
Select the region with the highest profit margin.

# Stages
The researcher has data related to the region to be studied in the following 3 files:
- */datasets/geo_data_0.csv*
- */datasets/geo_data_1.csv*
- */datasets/geo_data_2.csv*

There is no information regarding the quality of the data, so it needs to be checked first before further analysis.

First, an evaluation of the data quality will be carried out and see if there are any significant things that need to be followed up before the analysis process is carried out.

This project will consist of three stages:
- Data Overview
- Data Pre-processing
- Analysis
